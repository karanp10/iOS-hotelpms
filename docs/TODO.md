# Room Dashboard UX Improvements - Phase 1

## 🎯 Goal: Improve room dashboard with floor sections and enhanced room cards

## 📋 Current State Analysis
- ✅ Working room dashboard with basic grid layout
- ✅ Room cards show room number, occupancy, cleaning status  
- ✅ Basic filters (occupancy/cleaning/floor dropdowns)
- ❌ No floor grouping - rooms displayed in flat grid
- ❌ Limited room card information (no flags display, no last updated)
- ❌ Orange borders but unclear visual hierarchy

## 🚀 Phase 1 Plan: Simple Visual Improvements

### Task 1: Add Floor Sections to Grid 📍 ✅ COMPLETED
**Files to modify:** `RoomDashboardView.swift`
**Changes:**
- [x] Add `roomsByFloor` computed property to group rooms by floor
- [x] Replace flat `LazyVGrid` with `LazyVStack` containing floor sections
- [x] Each floor section: Header + `LazyVGrid` of rooms for that floor
- [x] Keep existing 4-column grid layout within each floor
- [x] Update room count display to show filtered vs total

### Task 2: Enhance Room Cards 🏠 ✅ COMPLETED
**Files to modify:** `RoomCard.swift`
**Changes:**
- [x] Add flags row below status section (if room has flags) - Already existed
- [x] Add "Last updated" footer with time and user info
- [x] Increase room number font size (make it more prominent)
- [x] Improve flag display with proper chips/icons - Already good
- [x] Add sample "last updated" data for testing

### Task 3: Visual Polish ✨ ✅ COMPLETED
**Files to modify:** `RoomCard.swift`
**Changes:** 
- [x] Better spacing and typography hierarchy
- [x] Improve card height to accommodate new information
- [x] Enhanced flag chip styling with colors and icons
- [x] Consistent padding and margins

## 📊 Expected Visual Changes
**Before:** Flat grid, basic room cards
**After:** 
- Floor-organized sections ("Floor 1", "Floor 2", etc.)
- Enhanced room cards with flags and metadata
- Better visual hierarchy and information density

## 🔄 Implementation Strategy (Per CLAUDE.md)
1. ✅ Create plan in TODO.md
2. ✅ Get approval before starting
3. 🔄 Implement Task 1 → **STOP** → test in simulator
4. 🔄 Implement Task 2 → **STOP** → test in simulator  
5. 🔄 Implement Task 3 → **STOP** → test in simulator
6. ✅ Update TODO.md with review

**Each task = one small change = immediate visual feedback in simulator**

## 📝 Implementation Notes
- Keep changes minimal and incremental
- Test in simulator after each task
- Focus on visual improvements that users will immediately notice
- Maintain existing functionality while enhancing UX
